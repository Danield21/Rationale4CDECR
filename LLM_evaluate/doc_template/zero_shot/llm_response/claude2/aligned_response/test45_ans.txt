Scott Peterson has been [found](#1) [guilty](#1) of first-degree [murder](#1) , a [verdict](#1) that [means](#1) he could be [executed](#1) if these same jurors [vote](#1) as the `` [conscience](#1) of their community '' that he [deserves](#1) to [die](#1) for his [crimes](#1). In essence , the jury [concluded](#1) that the [circumstances](#1) surrounding Laci Peterson 's [disappearance](#2) and [death](#2) could not reasonably be [explained](#1) [in any other way](#1) but that Scott Peterson [wanted](#1) her dead so he could [continue](#1) and perhaps [expand](#1) his [secret life](#1) with Amber Frey . Peterson was [found](#1) [guilty](#1) because jurors believed he had a [motive](#1) to [kill](#1) his wife and that Peterson 's [conduct](#1) -- before , during and after Laci Peterson 's [disappearance](#2) -- was too suspicious to be purely coincidental.

On November 12 , a jury in Redwood City , California , [convicted](#3) Scott Peterson of [first-degree murder](#3) in the [death](#3) of his wife , 23-year-old Laci , and [second-degree murder](#3) in the [death](#3) of his 8-month-old [unborn](#3) son , whom the couple were [planning](#3) to [name](#3) Conner . Laci [disappeared](#2) from the couple 's home in Modesto , California , 23 months ago . The bodies of Laci and Conner later [washed up](#2) in the San Francisco Bay , near where Scott [told](#3) police he had [gone](#3) [fishing](#3) the day his wife [disappeared](#2).

Dozens of people in Laci Peterson 's hometown who were [donating](#4) blood in her memory [applauded](#4) when they [heard](#4) a jury 's [decision](#4) to [execute](#4) Scott Peterson for the [murder](#4) of his pregnant wife

Laci Peterson 's loved ones [have](#5) `` a hole in their hearts that will never be [repaired](#5) , '' a prosecutor [told](#5) jurors today as he [asked](#5) them to [send](#5) [convicted](#5) double-murderer Scott Peterson to his [death](#5) for [killing](#5) his wife and [unborn](#5) son . The jury [convicted](#3) the 32-year-old Peterson on Nov. 12 of [first-degree murder](#3) for [killing](#3) his wife and [second-degree murder](#3) for the [death](#3) of his [unborn](#3) son . 

Peterson , 32 , was [convicted](#3) of two counts of [murder](#3) in the [deaths](#3) of his wife , Laci , and her fetus .

The case first [captured](#6) the nation 's [attention](#6) when Laci Peterson [disappeared](#2) from her Modesto home the day before Christmas 2002 and has [engrossed](#6) the country ever since . Unlike on Nov. 12 , when [sobs](#7) [filled](#7) the air as Peterson was [found](#1) [guilty](#1) of [murdering](#1) his wife and their [unborn](#7) child , there was an almost surreal [stillness](#8) in the courtroom while the [death recommendation](#8) was [announced](#8). Peterson was [convicted](#3) Nov. 12 of [first-degree murder](#3) for the [death](#3) of Laci Peterson and [second-degree murder](#3) for the [death](#3) of their [unborn](#3) son just before Christmas 2002 . The same jury that [recommended Peterson 's penalty](#8) [found](#1) him [guilty](#1) of the [first-degree murder](#1) of his wife and the [second-degree murder](#1) of his [unborn](#1) child .

A jury [found](#1) Scott Peterson guilty Friday of [killing](#1) his pregnant wife , Laci , and their [unborn](#1) child in the [saga](#9) of suburban [adultery](#9) and [betrayal](#9) that [transfixed](#9) much of the nation for nearly two years . Peterson , a 32-year-old fertilizer salesman from Modesto , [showed](#10) no [emotion](#10) , [staring](#10) stonily at the jury box as the foreman [announced](#10) a [finding](#10) of [first-degree murder](#10) in the [death](#10) of Laci and [second-degree murder](#10) in the [death](#10) of their near-term son , whom the couple had [named](#10) Conner .

Upon [learning](#11) of his [death sentence](#11) , Scott Peterson [sat](#11) defiantly still and tight-jawed , the same vacant expression he [wore](#11) throughout a [murder](#11) [trial](#11) in which he never [spoke](#11).
