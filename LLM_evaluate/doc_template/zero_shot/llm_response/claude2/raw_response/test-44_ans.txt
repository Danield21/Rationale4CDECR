Industry analysts [contacted](#cluster1) by eWEEK generally [say](#cluster2) they [believe](#cluster2) that Hewlett-Packard 's forthcoming $ 13.9 billion [acquisition](#cluster3) of Electronic Data Systems ? [announced](#cluster4) officially on May 13 is a good [move](#cluster5) for both companies , although there will be the usual integration [snafus](#cluster6) over vendor [neutrality](#cluster7) [issues](#cluster7) , business lines , [culture shock](#cluster8) and [layoffs](#cluster9) . For high-end enterprise IT [services](#cluster10) before this [merger](#cluster11) , the [market](#cluster12) [consisted of](#cluster13) IBM and everybody else . Overall , my [take](#cluster14) is that this [transaction](#cluster15) sounds great [in theory](#cluster16) , but there many potential [pitfalls](#cluster17) . At least initially , Sturm [said](#cluster18) , there will be little noticeable [impact](#cluster19) on customers from the [deal](#cluster3) . 

Hewlett-Packard is [negotiating](#cluster20) to [buy](#cluster21) [technology services](#cluster10) provider Electronic Data Systems in a [deal](#cluster3) that could [help](#cluster22) the world 's largest personal computer maker [snap up](#cluster23) more [data management](#cluster24) and [consulting](#cluster25) [contracts](#cluster26) . Palo Alto-based HP and Plano , Texas-based EDS [confirmed](#cluster27) the [talks](#cluster28) yesterday shortly after The Wall Street Journal [reported](#cluster29) a [deal](#cluster3) could be [reached](#cluster30) as early as today . With a [market value](#cluster31) of about $ 115 billion , HP could easily [use](#cluster32) its own stock to [finance](#cluster33) the [purchase](#cluster21) . If the [deal](#cluster3) is [completed](#cluster34) , [it](#cluster3) would be HP 's biggest [acquisition](#cluster35) since it [bought](#cluster36) Compaq Computer Corp. for $ 19 billion in 2002 . [Acquiring](#cluster37) EDS also could [yield](#cluster38) more government [work](#cluster39) for HP , which had about $ 500 million in prime federal [contracts](#cluster40) in fiscal 2007 .  

The all-cash [deal](#cluster3), [announced](#cluster41) Tuesday , [represents](#cluster42) HP 's biggest [gamble](#cluster43) under the [leadership](#cluster44) of Mark Hurd , who was [hired](#cluster45) as chief executive in March 2005 to [turn around](#cluster46) the maker of personal computers and printers . Hewlett-Packard 's [purchase](#cluster21) of Electronic Data Systems could [mean](#cluster47) tougher competition for IBM and its 10,500 Triangle employees . HP [estimates](#cluster48) that the [deal](#cluster3) , when [completed](#cluster49) , will [give](#cluster50) it about 7 percent of the [technology services](#cluster10) [market](#cluster51) , [compared](#cluster52) with IBM 's 10 percent share . `` It appears to be a very [daunting](#cluster53) [deal](#cluster3) , '' [said](#cluster54) American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu .

The [repercussions](#cluster55) from the [merger](#cluster11) of Electronic Data Systems ( EDS Quote - Cramer on EDS - Stock Picks ) with Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ Quote - Cramer on HPQ - Stock Picks ) will [ripple](#cluster56) broadly throughout the [tech industry](#cluster57) . H-P [announced](#cluster41) Tuesday that it will [buy](#cluster21) the outsourcing [services](#cluster10) company for $ 13.9 billion . The [deal](#cluster3) will be bad `` for anyone that does n't [have](#cluster58) H-P or IBM ( IBM Quote - Cramer on IBM - Stock Picks ) on their business card , '' [said](#cluster59) IDC analyst Bob Welch .

[Industry](#cluster1) sources have [confirmed](#cluster60) to eWEEK that Hewlett-Packard will [acquire](#cluster37) Electronic Data Systems for about $ 13 billion . The [announcement](#cluster61) may [come](#cluster62) as early as May 14 , the source [told](#cluster63) eWEEK . `` There can be no [assurances](#cluster64) that an [agreement](#cluster65) will be [reached](#cluster30) or that a [transaction](#cluster15) will be [consummated](#cluster66) , '' HP [said](#cluster67) in a [statement](#cluster68) . In [response](#cluster69) to [market](#cluster12) [rumors](#cluster70) , Electronic Data Systems Corporation [announces](#cluster71) that it is in advanced [discussions](#cluster72) regarding a possible business combination [transaction](#cluster15) with Hewlett-Packard Company . The [impending](#cluster73) [deal](#cluster3) would [make](#cluster74) the newly merged company worth about $ 22 billion and [put it on a level](#cluster75) with IBM , the largest IT services company in the world .

It 's too early to [tell](#cluster76) what [impact](#cluster19) - if any - Hewlett-Packard Co. 's decision to [acquire](#cluster37) Electronic Data Systems Corp. will [have](#cluster77) on EDS ' [operations](#cluster78) in South Charleston , an EDS spokesman [said](#cluster79) . Earlier this month Hewlett-Packard [unveiled](#cluster80) a [bid](#cluster81) of nearly $ 14 billion bid to [purchase](#cluster21) EDS . Bill Ritz , EDS spokesman , [pointed out](#cluster82) that Hewlett-Packard 's [acquisition](#cluster35) of EDS still [needs](#cluster83) the [approval](#cluster84) of regulators and EDS ' stockholders . `` The [deal](#cluster3) is [supposed](#cluster85) to [close](#cluster86) sometime in the second half of 2008 , '' Ritz [said](#cluster79) . 

Hewlett-Packard 's CEO [says](#cluster87) he [believes](#cluster88) the EDS [acquisition](#cluster35) will [make](#cluster89) the company 's [service offerings](#cluster90) stronger . Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd [believes](#cluster88) that the $ 13 billion [acquisition](#cluster35) of Electronic Data Systems will [help](#cluster91) [build out](#cluster92) HP 's enterprise [services offerings](#cluster90) and `` [accelerate](#cluster93) '' the company 's [reach](#cluster94) into new accounts , he [said](#cluster95) . In a May 20 [conference call](#cluster96) with reporters to [announce](#cluster97) HP 's 2008 second-quarter financial earnings , Hurd [offered](#cluster98) his [thoughts](#cluster99) on the upcoming [acquisition](#cluster35) of EDS . While Hurd could not [say](#cluster100) when the [deal](#cluster3) would [close](#cluster86) , he [noted](#cluster101) that HP is already [looking at](#cluster102) [ways](#cluster103) to [integrate](#cluster104) its software and services portfolio with EDS ' [business](#cluster105) .
