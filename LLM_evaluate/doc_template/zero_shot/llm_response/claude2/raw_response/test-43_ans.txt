Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) Chief Executive Hector Ruiz [waxed metaphorical](#1) as he [described](#2) his company 's [acquisition](#3) of ATI Technologies ( ATYT ) . Chipmaker AMD , [hoping](#4) to [gain](#5) [a leg up](#6) on a resurgent rival Intel ( INTC ) , on July 24 [ended](#7) months of [speculation](#8) by [saying](#9) it would [buy](#10) graphics chipmaker ATI for about $ 5.4 billion . Maybe that 's why Intel and Nvidia ( NVDA ) , the companies ' two biggest rivals , [found](#11) a lot to [smile](#12) about on July 24 , the day the [deal](#13) was [announced](#14) . Intel , the world 's largest graphics-chipmaker , [declined](#15) to [comment](#16) specifically on the [deal](#17) . The [merger](#18) also could [lock ATI out](#19) of the [business](#20) of [supplying](#21) graphics chipsets to Intel-based PCs , worth about $ 90 million a year in revenue . AMD [says](#22) there 's plenty of [reason](#23) to be bullish on the [deal](#24) .

RBC Capital Markets [downgraded](#25) ATI Technologies to `` [sector perform](#26) '' from `` [outperform](#27) '' after Advanced Micro Devices [announced](#28) its [intention](#29) to [buy](#30) the Canadian graphics chip-maker for $ 5.4 billion on Monday . Even though the [takeover](#31) [looks](#32) fairly [valued](#33) , RBC analyst Steve Arthur [said](#34) there is [limited](#35) [upside](#36) to the [offer](#37) unless [competing](#38) [bids](#39) are [made](#40) for ATI . For now , Arthur [said](#41) AMD 's [takeover](#42) [deal](#43) , which is [expected](#44) to [close](#45) in the fourth quarter , effectively [offers](#46) his one-year price target of $ 21 now .

The pitched [battle](#47) for [supremacy](#48) in the [chip-making market](#49) [reached](#50) a critical phase yesterday with Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) in Sunnyvale , Calif . [announcing](#51) its [decision](#52) to [acquire](#53) Canadian graphic cards manufacturer ATI Technologies ( ATI ) . The imminent [purchase](#54) of ATI , analysts [say](#55) , is the most vital element in AMD 's concerted [campaign](#56) to [dethrone](#57) the mighty Intel Corp . AMD [agreed](#58) to [buy](#59) Markham , Ont-based ATI for around $ 5.4 billion in cash and stock , the companies [announced](#60) Monday . The [acquisition](#61) , which is [subject](#62) to shareholder and regulatory [approvals](#63) , would [turn](#64) AMD into one of the world 's largest providers of graphics chips . `` You wo n't [see](#65) it tomorrow , but the [merger](#66) will potentially [put AMD on a more equal footing with](#67) Intel , '' [said](#68) Michelle Warren , an analyst with Evans Research in Toronto . Another Canadian analyst [noted](#69) that the [merger](#70) was likely to [bring](#71) significant benefits to both companies . The marketing [message](#72) from ATI executives too is all about the 'mutual benefits ' of the proposed [acquisition](#73) . Hartog [said](#74) the [purchase](#75) of ATI by AMD will [involve](#76) ' some [changes](#77) ' but he [downplayed](#78) any potential [lay-offs](#79) from among the company 's more than 3,000 employees .

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. [shook up](#80) the personal [computer industry](#81) by [buying](#82) ATI Technologies Inc. for US $ 5.4-billion yesterday , [opening up](#83) a new [front](#84) in the [battle](#85) with Intel Corp. to [control](#86) the computer [chip market](#87) . The [deal](#88) , which had been [anticipated](#89) for over a year , [gives](#90) AMD high-end graphics technology and [bolsters](#91) the company 's [strategy](#92) to [overtake](#93) Intel as the dominant supplier of chips that [power](#94) personal computers and other devices .

Advanced Micro Devices ( NYSE : AMD ) [announced](#95) the largest [acquisition](#96) in its [history](#97) Monday , [paying](#98) about $ 5.4 billion to [acquire](#99) graphics chip specialist ATI Technologies . The [acquisition](#100) will [let](#101) AMD [expand](#102) its [position](#103) in the commercial desktop and mobile computing [markets](#104) , two areas where the company has not had much [success](#105) . `` Together we [intend](#106) to [create](#107) a [processing](#108) powerhouse , '' [said](#109) Hector Ruiz , chairman and chief executive of AMD , during a [teleconference](#110) to [announce](#111) the [deal](#112) . The [purchase](#113) is a [combination](#114) of $ 4.2 billion in cash and 57 million shares of AMD stock .

[Addressing](#115) a [deficiency](#116) of its own and further upping the competitive [tension](#117) between it and chief rival Intel ( nasdaq : INTC - news - people ) , Advanced Micro Devices ( nyse : AMD - news - people ) [intends](#118) to [acquire](#119) graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies ( nasdaq : ATYT - news - people ) in a $ 5.4 billion [deal](#120) . We [think](#121) not too much worse off than before the [deal](#122) , and [believe](#123) shares in the company [remain](#124) a compelling [way](#125) to [play](#126) [growth](#127) in [gaming-](#128) and [media-oriented](#129) [computing](#130) . Our [view](#131) of the Advanced Micro Devices / ATI Technologies [deal](#132) is that [it](#133) 's the last major [move](#134) AMD [needed](#135) to [make](#136) to [match](#137) Intel 's [breadth](#138) in the processor [market](#139) ( now that Intel has [shed](#140) its [communications](#141) processor [business](#142) ) .

Yesterday Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD ) , a leading global CPU maker , [announced](#143) its [purchase](#144) of Canada-based graphics chips maker ATI Technologies Inc. in a US $ 5.4 billion [deal](#145) [that](#146) many [said](#147) would [help](#148) AMD [compete](#149) more effectively with Intel Corp. , its largest-in-the-world rival . In a news [conference](#150) [announcing](#151) the [merger](#152) [held](#153) in Taipei yesterday , Henri Richard , executive vice president of AMD , [urged](#154) investors not to [worry](#155) as ATI 's [relations](#156) with TSMC and its rival United Microelectronics Corp. would not [change](#157) . The [merger](#158) , meanwhile , is also [expected](#159) to [create](#160) an [impact](#161) on Taiwan 's chipset manufacturers . 

AMD 's ATI [acquisition](#162) will not affect India operations The AMD statement [said](#163) , `` We can not [speculate](#164) on the [implications](#165) of the [merger](#166) for another 90-120 days , till the time [integration](#167) is [complete](#168) . ''
