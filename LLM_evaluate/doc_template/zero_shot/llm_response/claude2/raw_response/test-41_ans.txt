Israel 's [assault](#1) on Gaza has [exacted](#2) the bloodiest [toll](#3) of civilian lives yet , when the [bombing](#4) of UN schools being [used](#5) as refugee centres and of housing [killed](#6) more than 50 people , including an entire family of seven young children . Doctors in Gaza [said](#7) more than 40 people [died](#8) , including children , in what appears to be the biggest single [loss of life](#9) of the [campaign](#10) when Israeli bombs [hit](#11) al-Fakhora school , in Jabaliya refugee camp , while it was [packed](#12) with hundreds of people who had [fled](#13) the [fighting](#14) . 

No militants were [inside](#15) a United Nations-run school [attacked](#16) by Israeli forces in Gaza , [leaving 40 people dead](#17) , the UN [says](#18) .

The United Nations on Wednesday [denied](#19) Israel Defense Forces [claims](#20) that there were Palestinian militants in the Gaza school [bombed](#21) by Israel on Tuesday .

SEVENTEEN hours after the [attack](#22) on one of his schools [killed](#23) 40 Palestinians [seeking](#24) [shelter](#25) from Israel 's [war](#26) on Hamas , the United Nations ' director of operations in Gaza , John Ging , was certain of at least one thing `` We have [established](#27) beyond any [doubt](#28) that the school was not being [used](#29) by any militants , '' Mr Ging [told](#30) The Age last night . [Speaking](#31) by phone from the UN 's Relief and Works Agency in Gaza , Mr Ging [struggled](#32) to [contain](#33) his [anger](#34) at the [attack](#35) that has also [left](#36) more 50 people with serious [injuries](#37) , 10 of whom [remain](#38) critical . When the Israeli [attack](#39) [came](#40) on the Prep C girls school in the Jabaliya camp at 3.45pm on Tuesday , Mr Ging [said](#41) about 350 Palestinians were inside , [using](#42) the school as a shelter . The [attack](#43) on the school has [caused](#44) widespread [shock](#45) across Israel , [intensifying](#46) [pressure](#47) on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to [reach](#48) a [ceasefire](#49) .

Some 30 people were [killed](#50) and 55 others [injured](#51) , five of them critically , when three artillery shells [landed](#52) at the perimeter of a school , which usually serves as a girls ' preparatory school , in the Jabaliya refugee camp , [according to](#53) John Ging , UNRWA 's Director of Operations .

[Pressure](#54) to [obtain](#55) a [ceasefire](#56) in Gaza has been [mounting](#57) , with the EU [warning](#58) Israel it was `` [destroying](#59) '' its image , while Israeli forces on Tuesday ( 6 January ) [killed](#60) at least 40 people during an [attack](#61) on a United Nations-run school in Gaza . The Israeli [attack](#62) on the Fakhora school in the northern town of Jabaliya , which also [wounded](#63) around 100 people , was the deadliest single [strike](#64) of the offensive so far and the third UN school to come under fire within 24 hours . The [bombing](#65) has [drawn](#66) international [condemnation](#67) , with the EU [calling](#68) [it](#69) `` completely unacceptable . '' `` We [think](#70) the [attack](#71) is completely unacceptable and strongly [condemn](#72) the fact that civilians were [hit](#73) while [sheltering](#74) themselves from the [violence](#75) , '' [said](#76) Cristina Gallach , spokesperson of EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana .

An Israeli [mortar strike](#77) that [killed](#78) about 40 Palestinians [sheltering](#79) in a UN school Tuesday [brought](#80) new urgency to diplomatic efforts to [end](#81) Israel 's military onslaught in the Gaza Strip , as the UN Security Council [met](#82) to [discuss](#83) the [crisis](#84) . The Israeli army [said](#85) the UN school in the Jabaliya refugee camp was [hit](#86) when troops [responded](#87) to a [mortar attack](#88) from the grounds and that the dead [included](#89) a number of Hamas militants . The [mortar strike](#90) in Jabaliya was the second [attack](#91) on a school [run](#92) by the UN Relief and Works Agency , or UNRWA .

The civilian [death toll](#93) in Gaza [increased](#94) dramatically today , with [reports](#95) of more than 40 Palestinians [killed](#96) after missiles [exploded](#97) outside a UN school where hundreds of people were [sheltering](#98) from the continuing Israeli [offensive](#99) . Two Israeli tank shells [struck](#100) the school in Jabaliya refugee camp , [spraying](#101) shrapnel on people inside and outside the building , [according to](#102) news agency [reports](#103) . Majed Hamdan , an AP photographer , who [rushed](#104) to the scene shortly after the [attacks](#105) , [said](#106) many children were among the dead .

Three shells [hit](#113) Fakhura , a girls elementary school in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza , at about 3pm on Tuesday ( 12am yesterday ) , [according to](#114) UN Relief and Works Agency spokesman Christopher Gunness . Israel [moved](#115) quickly to [explain](#116) the [attack](#117) on the Jabalya school , [saying](#118) its forces had been [fired on](#119) first .
