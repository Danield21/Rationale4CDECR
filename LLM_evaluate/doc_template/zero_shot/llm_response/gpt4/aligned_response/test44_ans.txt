Industry analysts contacted by eWEEK generally say they believe that Hewlett-Packard 's forthcoming $ 13.9 billion [acquisition](#1) of Electronic Data Systems ? [announced](#2) officially on May 13 is a good [move](#3) for both companies , although there will be the usual integration [snafus](#4) over vendor [neutrality issues](#5) , business lines , [culture shock](#6) and [layoffs](#7) . For high-end enterprise IT [services](#8) before this [merger](#9) , the [market consisted of](#10) IBM and everybody else . Overall , my [take](#11) is that this [transaction](#12) sounds great [in theory](#13) , but there many potential [pitfalls](#14) . At least initially , Sturm [said](#15) , there will be little noticeable [impact](#16) on customers from the [deal](#17) .

Hewlett-Packard is [negotiating](#18) to [buy](#19) [technology services](#20) provider Electronic Data Systems in a [deal](#21) that could [help](#22) the world 's largest personal computer maker [snap up](#23) more [data management](#24) and [consulting contracts](#25) . Palo Alto-based HP and Plano , Texas-based EDS [confirmed](#26) the [talks](#27) yesterday shortly after The Wall Street Journal [reported](#28) a [deal](#29) could be [reached](#30) as early as today . With a [market value](#31) of about $ 115 billion , HP could easily [use](#32) its own stock to [finance](#33) the [purchase](#34) . If the [deal](#35) is [completed](#36) , [it](#37) would be HP 's biggest [acquisition](#38) since it [bought](#39) Compaq Computer Corp. for $ 19 billion in 2002 . [Acquiring](#40) EDS also could [yield](#41) more government [work](#42) for HP , which had about $ 500 million in prime federal [contracts](#43) in fiscal 2007 .

The all-cash [deal](#44) , [announced](#45) Tuesday , [represents](#46) HP 's biggest [gamble](#47) under the [leadership](#48) of Mark Hurd , who was [hired](#49) as chief executive in March 2005 to [turn around](#50) the maker of personal computers and printers . Hewlett-Packard 's [purchase](#51) of Electronic Data Systems could [mean](#52) tougher competition for IBM and its 10,500 Triangle employees . HP [estimates](#53) that the [deal](#54) , when [completed](#55) , will [give](#56) it about 7 percent of the [technology services market](#57) , [compared](#58) with IBM 's 10 percent share . `` It appears to be a very [daunting deal](#59) , '' [said](#60) American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu .

The [repercussions](#61) from the [merger](#62) of Electronic Data Systems ( EDS Quote - Cramer on EDS - Stock Picks ) with Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ Quote - Cramer on HPQ - Stock Picks ) will [ripple](#63) broadly throughout the [tech industry](#64) . H-P [announced](#65) Tuesday that it will [buy](#66) the outsourcing [services](#67) company for $ 13.9 billion . The [deal](#68) will be bad `` for anyone that does n't [have](#69) H-P or IBM ( IBM Quote - Cramer on IBM - Stock Picks ) on their business card , '' [said](#70) IDC analyst Bob Welch .

[Industry](#71) sources have [confirmed](#72) to eWEEK that Hewlett-Packard will [acquire](#73) Electronic Data Systems for about $ 13 billion . The [announcement](#74) may [come](#75) as early as May 14 , the source [told](#76) eWEEK . `` There can be no [assurances](#77) that an [agreement](#78) will be [reached](#79) or that a [transaction](#80) will be [consummated](#81) , '' HP [said](#82) in a [statement](#83) . In [response](#84) to [market rumors](#85) , Electronic Data Systems Corporation [announces](#86) that it is in advanced [discussions](#87) regarding a possible business combination [transaction](#88) with Hewlett-Packard Company . The [impending deal](#89) would [make](#90) the newly merged company worth about $ 22 billion and [put it on a level](#91) with IBM , the largest IT services company in the world .

It 's too early to [tell](#92) what [impact](#93) - if any - Hewlett-Packard Co. 's decision to [acquire](#94) Electronic Data Systems Corp. will [have](#95) on EDS ' [operations](#96) in South Charleston , an EDS spokesman [said](#97) . Earlier this month Hewlett-Packard [unveiled](#98) a [bid](#99) of nearly $ 14 billion bid to [purchase](#100) EDS . Bill Ritz , EDS spokesman , [pointed out](#101) that Hewlett-Packard 's [acquisition](#102) of EDS still [needs](#103) the [approval](#104) of regulators and EDS ' stockholders . `` The [deal](#105) is [supposed](#106) to [close](#107) sometime in the second half of 2008 , '' Ritz [said](#108) .

Hewlett-Packard 's CEO [says](#109) he [believes](#110) the EDS [acquisition](#111) will [make](#112) the company 's [service offerings](#113) stronger . Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd [believes](#114) that the $ 13 billion [acquisition](#115) of Electronic Data Systems will [help build out](#116) HP 's enterprise [services offerings](#117) and `` [accelerate](#118) '' the company 's [reach](#119) into new accounts , he [said](#120) . In a May 20 [conference call](#121) with reporters to [announce](#122) HP 's 2008 second-quarter financial earnings , Hurd [offered](#123) his [thoughts](#124) on the upcoming [acquisition](#125) of EDS . While Hurd could not [say](#126) when the [deal](#127) would [close](#128) , he [noted](#129) that HP is already [looking at ways](#130) to [integrate](#131) its software and services portfolio with EDS ' [business](#132) .
