Scott Peterson has been [found](#event1) [guilty](#event1) of first-degree [murder](#event1) , a [verdict](#event2) that [means](#event2) he could be [executed](#event3) if these same jurors [vote](#event4) as the `` [conscience](#event4) of their community '' that he [deserves](#event5) to [die](#event5) for his [crimes](#event1) . In essence , the jury [concluded](#event6) that the [circumstances](#event6) surrounding Laci Peterson 's [disappearance](#event7) and [death](#event1) could not reasonably be [explained](#event8) [in any other way](#event8) but that Scott Peterson [wanted](#event9) her dead so he could [continue](#event10) and perhaps [expand](#event10) his [secret life](#event10) with Amber Frey . Peterson was [found](#event1) [guilty](#event1) because jurors believed he had a [motive](#event9) to [kill](#event1) his wife and that Peterson 's [conduct](#event11) -- before , during and after Laci Peterson 's [disappearance](#event7) -- was too suspicious to be purely coincidental .

On November 12 , a jury in Redwood City , California , [convicted](#event1) Scott Peterson of [first-degree murder](#event1) in the [death](#event1) of his wife , 23-year-old Laci , and [second-degree murder](#event12) in the [death](#event12) of his 8-month-old [unborn](#event12) son , whom the couple were [planning](#event13) to [name](#event13) Conner . Laci [disappeared](#event7) from the couple 's home in Modesto , California , 23 months ago . The bodies of Laci and Conner later [washed up](#event14) in the San Francisco Bay , near where Scott [told](#event15) police he had [gone](#event15) [fishing](#event15) the day his wife [disappeared](#event7) .

Dozens of people in Laci Peterson 's hometown who were [donating](#event16) blood in her memory [applauded](#event17) when they [heard](#event18) a jury 's [decision](#event3) to [execute](#event3) Scott Peterson for the [murder](#event1) of his pregnant wife

Laci Peterson 's loved ones [have](#event19) `` a hole in their hearts that will never be [repaired](#event19) , '' a prosecutor [told](#event20) jurors today as he [asked](#event21) them to [send](#event22) [convicted](#event1) double-murderer Scott Peterson to his [death](#event3) for [killing](#event1) his wife and [unborn](#event12) son . The jury [convicted](#event1) the 32-year-old Peterson on Nov. 12 of [first-degree murder](#event1) for [killing](#event1) his wife and [second-degree murder](#event12) for the [death](#event12) of his [unborn](#event12) son .

Peterson , 32 , was [convicted](#event1) of two counts of [murder](#event1) in the [deaths](#event1) of his wife , Laci , and her fetus .

The case first [captured](#event23) the nation 's [attention](#event23) when Laci Peterson [disappeared](#event7) from her Modesto home the day before Christmas 2002 and has [engrossed](#event24) the country ever since . Unlike on Nov. 12 , when [sobs](#event25) [filled](#event25) the air as Peterson was [found](#event1) [guilty](#event1) of [murdering](#event1) his wife and their [unborn](#event12) child , there was an almost surreal [stillness](#event26) in the courtroom while the [death recommendation](#event3) was [announced](#event27) . Peterson was [convicted](#event1) Nov. 12 of [first-degree murder](#event1) for the [death](#event1) of Laci Peterson and [second-degree murder](#event12) for the [death](#event12) of their [unborn](#event12) son just before Christmas 2002 . The same jury that [recommended Peterson 's penalty](#event3) [found](#event1) him [guilty](#event1) of the [first-degree murder](#event1) of his wife and the [second-degree murder](#event12) of his [unborn](#event12) child .

A jury [found](#event1) Scott Peterson guilty Friday of [killing](#event1) his pregnant wife , Laci , and their [unborn](#event12) child in the [saga](#event28) of suburban [adultery](#event29) and [betrayal](#event29) that [transfixed](#event30) much of the nation for nearly two years . Peterson , a 32-year-old fertilizer salesman from Modesto , [showed](#event31) no [emotion](#event31) , [staring](#event31) stonily at the jury box as the foreman [announced](#event27) a [finding](#event1) of [first-degree murder](#event1) in the [death](#event1) of Laci and [second-degree murder](#event12) in the [death](#event12) of their near-term son , whom the couple had [named](#event13) Conner .

Upon [learning](#event32) of his [death sentence](#event3) , Scott Peterson [sat](#event33) defiantly still and tight-jawed , the same vacant expression he [wore](#event34) throughout a [murder](#event1) [trial](#event35) in which he never [spoke](#event36) .
