Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) Chief Executive Hector Ruiz [waxed metaphorical](#event1) as he [described](#event2) his company 's [acquisition](#event3) of ATI Technologies ( ATYT ) . Chipmaker AMD , [hoping](#event4) to [gain](#event5) [a leg up](#event6) on a resurgent rival Intel ( INTC ) , on July 24 [ended](#event7) months of [speculation](#event8) by [saying](#event9) it would [buy](#event10) graphics chipmaker ATI for about $ 5.4 billion . Maybe that 's why Intel and Nvidia ( NVDA ) , the companies ' two biggest rivals , [found](#event11) a lot to [smile](#event12) about on July 24 , the day the [deal](#event3) was [announced](#event13) . Intel , the world 's largest graphics-chipmaker , [declined](#event14) to [comment](#event15) specifically on the [deal](#event3) . The [merger](#event3) also could [lock ATI out](#event16) of the [business](#event17) of [supplying](#event18) graphics chipsets to Intel-based PCs , worth about $ 90 million a year in revenue . AMD [says](#event19) there 's plenty of [reason](#event20) to be bullish on the [deal](#event3) .

RBC Capital Markets [downgraded](#event21) ATI Technologies to `` [sector perform](#event22) '' from `` [outperform](#event23) '' after Advanced Micro Devices [announced](#event13) its [intention](#event24) to [buy](#event10) the Canadian graphics chip-maker for $ 5.4 billion on Monday . Even though the [takeover](#event3) [looks](#event25) fairly [valued](#event26) , RBC analyst Steve Arthur [said](#event27) there is [limited](#event28) [upside](#event29) to the [offer](#event30) unless [competing](#event31) [bids](#event32) are [made](#event33) for ATI . For now , Arthur [said](#event34) AMD 's [takeover](#event3) [deal](#event3) , which is [expected](#event35) to [close](#event36) in the fourth quarter , effectively [offers](#event37) his one-year price target of $ 21 now .

The pitched [battle](#event38) for [supremacy](#event39) in the [chip-making market](#event40) [reached](#event41) a critical phase yesterday with Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) in Sunnyvale , Calif . [announcing](#event13) its [decision](#event42) to [acquire](#event3) Canadian graphic cards manufacturer ATI Technologies ( ATI ) . The imminent [purchase](#event3) of ATI , analysts [say](#event43) , is the most vital element in AMD 's concerted [campaign](#event44) to [dethrone](#event45) the mighty Intel Corp . AMD [agreed](#event46) to [buy](#event10) Markham , Ont-based ATI for around $ 5.4 billion in cash and stock , the companies [announced](#event13) Monday . The [acquisition](#event3) , which is [subject](#event47) to shareholder and regulatory [approvals](#event48) , would [turn](#event49) AMD into one of the world 's largest providers of graphics chips . `` You wo n't [see](#event50) it tomorrow , but the [merger](#event3) will potentially [put AMD on a more equal footing with](#event51) Intel , '' [said](#event52) Michelle Warren , an analyst with Evans Research in Toronto . Another Canadian analyst [noted](#event53) that the [merger](#event3) was likely to [bring](#event54) significant benefits to both companies . The marketing [message](#event55) from ATI executives too is all about the 'mutual benefits ' of the proposed [acquisition](#event3) . Hartog [said](#event56) the [purchase](#event3) of ATI by AMD will [involve](#event57) ' some [changes](#event58) ' but he [downplayed](#event59) any potential [lay-offs](#event60) from among the company 's more than 3,000 employees .

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. [shook up](#event61) the personal [computer industry](#event62) by [buying](#event10) ATI Technologies Inc. for US $ 5.4-billion yesterday , [opening up](#event63) a new [front](#event64) in the [battle](#event38) with Intel Corp. to [control](#event65) the computer [chip market](#event40) . The [deal](#event3) , which had been [anticipated](#event66) for over a year , [gives](#event67) AMD high-end graphics technology and [bolsters](#event68) the company 's [strategy](#event69) to [overtake](#event70) Intel as the dominant supplier of chips that [power](#event71) personal computers and other devices .

Advanced Micro Devices ( NYSE : AMD ) [announced](#event13) the largest [acquisition](#event3) in its [history](#event72) Monday , [paying](#event73) about $ 5.4 billion to [acquire](#event3) graphics chip specialist ATI Technologies . The [acquisition](#event3) will [let](#event74) AMD [expand](#event75) its [position](#event76) in the commercial desktop and mobile computing [markets](#event77) , two areas where the company has not had much [success](#event78) . `` Together we [intend](#event79) to [create](#event80) a [processing](#event81) powerhouse , '' [said](#event82) Hector Ruiz , chairman and chief executive of AMD , during a [teleconference](#event83) to [announce](#event13) the [deal](#event3) . The [purchase](#event3) is a [combination](#event84) of $ 4.2 billion in cash and 57 million shares of AMD stock .

[Addressing](#event85) a [deficiency](#event86) of its own and further upping the competitive [tension](#event87) between it and chief rival Intel ( nasdaq : INTC - news - people ) , Advanced Micro Devices ( nyse : AMD - news - people ) [intends](#event79) to [acquire](#event3) graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies ( nasdaq : ATYT - news - people ) in a $ 5.4 billion [deal](#event3) . We [think](#event88) not too much worse off than before the [deal](#event3) , and [believe](#event89) shares in the company [remain](#event90) a compelling [way](#event91) to [play](#event92) [growth](#event93) in [gaming-](#event94) and [media-oriented](#event95) [computing](#event96) . Our [view](#event97) of the Advanced Micro Devices / ATI Technologies [deal](#event3) is that [it](#event3) 's the last major [move](#event98) AMD [needed](#event99) to [make](#event100) to [match](#event101) Intel 's [breadth](#event102) in the processor [market](#event40) ( now that Intel has [shed](#event103) its [communications](#event104) processor [business](#event105) ) .

Yesterday Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD ) , a leading global CPU maker , [announced](#event13) its [purchase](#event3) of Canada-based graphics chips maker ATI Technologies Inc. in a US $ 5.4 billion [deal](#event3) [that](#event106) many [said](#event107) would [help](#event108) AMD [compete](#event109) more effectively with Intel Corp. , its largest-in-the-world rival . In a news [conference](#event110) [announcing](#event13) the [merger](#event3) [held](#event111) in Taipei yesterday , Henri Richard , executive vice president of AMD , [urged](#event112) investors not to [worry](#event113) as ATI 's [relations](#event114) with TSMC and its rival United Microelectronics Corp. would not [change](#event115) . The [merger](#event3) , meanwhile , is also [expected](#event116) to [create](#event117) an [impact](#event118) on Taiwan 's chipset manufacturers .

AMD 's ATI [acquisition](#event3) will not affect India operations The AMD statement [said](#event119) , `` We can not [speculate](#event120) on the [implications](#event121) of the [merger](#event3) for another 90-120 days , till the time [integration](#event122) is [complete](#event123) . ''
