Scott Peterson has been [found](#cluster5) [guilty](#cluster9) of first-degree [murder](#cluster6) , a [verdict](#cluster7) that [means](#cluster1) he could be [executed](#cluster4) if these same jurors [vote](#cluster3) as the `` [conscience](#cluster8) of their community '' that he [deserves](#cluster2) to [die](#cluster4) for his [crimes](#cluster6) . In essence , the jury [concluded](#cluster16) that the [circumstances](#cluster19) surrounding Laci Peterson 's [disappearance](#cluster15) and [death](#cluster14) could not reasonably be [explained](#cluster12) [in any other way](#cluster18) but that Scott Peterson [wanted](#cluster13) her dead so he could [continue](#cluster10) and perhaps [expand](#cluster11) his [secret life](#cluster17) with Amber Frey . Peterson was [found](#cluster5) [guilty](#cluster9) because jurors believed he had a [motive](#cluster21) to [kill](#cluster6) his wife and that Peterson 's [conduct](#cluster20) -- before , during and after Laci Peterson 's [disappearance](#cluster15) -- was too suspicious to be purely coincidental .

On November 12 , a jury in Redwood City , California , [convicted](#cluster5) Scott Peterson of [first-degree murder](#cluster23) in the [death](#cluster14) of his wife , 23-year-old Laci , and [second-degree murder](#cluster22) in the [death](#cluster26) of his 8-month-old [unborn](#cluster27) son , whom the couple were [planning](#cluster24) to [name](#cluster25) Conner . Laci [disappeared](#cluster15) from the couple 's home in Modesto , California , 23 months ago . The bodies of Laci and Conner later [washed up](#cluster28) in the San Francisco Bay , near where Scott [told](#cluster31) police he had [gone](#cluster30) [fishing](#cluster29) the day his wife [disappeared](#cluster15) .

Dozens of people in Laci Peterson 's hometown who were [donating](#cluster33) blood in her memory [applauded](#cluster32) when they [heard](#cluster34) a jury 's [decision](#cluster5) to [execute](#cluster4) Scott Peterson for the [murder](#cluster14) of his pregnant wife

Laci Peterson 's loved ones [have](#cluster35) `` a hole in their hearts that will never be [repaired](#cluster39) , '' a prosecutor [told](#cluster37) jurors today as he [asked](#cluster38) them to [send](#cluster36) [convicted](#cluster5) double-murderer Scott Peterson to his [death](#cluster4) for [killing](#cluster23) his wife and [unborn](#cluster27) son . The jury [convicted](#cluster5) the 32-year-old Peterson on Nov. 12 of [first-degree murder](#cluster23) for [killing](#cluster14) his wife and [second-degree murder](#cluster6) for the [death](#cluster26) of his [unborn](#cluster27) son .

Peterson , 32 , was [convicted](#cluster5) of two counts of [murder](#cluster6) in the [deaths](#cluster40) of his wife , Laci , and her fetus .

The case first [captured](#cluster41) the nation 's [attention](#cluster43) when Laci Peterson [disappeared](#cluster15) from her Modesto home the day before Christmas 2002 and has [engrossed](#cluster42) the country ever since . Unlike on Nov. 12 , when [sobs](#cluster45) [filled](#cluster44) the air as Peterson was [found](#cluster5) [guilty](#cluster9) of [murdering](#cluster23) his wife and their [unborn](#cluster27) child , there was an almost surreal [stillness](#cluster47) in the courtroom while the [death recommendation](#cluster4) was [announced](#cluster46) . Peterson was [convicted](#cluster5) Nov. 12 of [first-degree murder](#cluster23) for the [death](#cluster14) of Laci Peterson and [second-degree murder](#cluster6) for the [death](#cluster26) of their [unborn](#cluster27) son just before Christmas 2002 . The same jury that [recommended Peterson 's penalty](#cluster4) [found](#cluster5) him [guilty](#cluster9) of the [first-degree murder](#cluster23) of his wife and the [second-degree murder](#cluster6) of his [unborn](#cluster27) child .

A jury [found](#cluster5) Scott Peterson guilty Friday of [killing](#cluster23) his pregnant wife , Laci , and their [unborn](#cluster27) child in the [saga](#cluster51) of suburban [adultery](#cluster49) and [betrayal](#cluster50) that [transfixed](#cluster48) much of the nation for nearly two years . Peterson , a 32-year-old fertilizer salesman from Modesto , [showed](#cluster52) no [emotion](#cluster56) , [staring](#cluster54) stonily at the jury box as the foreman [announced](#cluster55) a [finding](#cluster5) of [first-degree murder](#cluster23) in the [death](#cluster14) of Laci and [second-degree murder](#cluster22) in the [death](#cluster26) of their near-term son , whom the couple had [named](#cluster53) Conner .

Upon [learning](#cluster57) of his [death sentence](#cluster4) , Scott Peterson [sat](#cluster59) defiantly still and tight-jawed , the same vacant expression he [wore](#cluster60) throughout a [murder](#cluster6) [trial](#cluster58) in which he never [spoke](#cluster61) .
