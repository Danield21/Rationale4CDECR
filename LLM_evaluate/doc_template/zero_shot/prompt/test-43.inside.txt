Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) Chief Executive Hector Ruiz [waxed metaphorical](#cluster1) as he [described](#cluster3) his company 's [acquisition](#cluster2) of ATI Technologies ( ATYT ) . Chipmaker AMD , [hoping](#cluster6) to [gain](#cluster7) [a leg up](#cluster8) on a resurgent rival Intel ( INTC ) , on July 24 [ended](#cluster4) months of [speculation](#cluster5) by [saying](#cluster9) it would [buy](#cluster2) graphics chipmaker ATI for about $ 5.4 billion . Maybe that 's why Intel and Nvidia ( NVDA ) , the companies ' two biggest rivals , [found](#cluster10) a lot to [smile](#cluster11) about on July 24 , the day the [deal](#cluster2) was [announced](#cluster9) . Intel , the world 's largest graphics-chipmaker , [declined](#cluster13) to [comment](#cluster12) specifically on the [deal](#cluster2) . The [merger](#cluster2) also could [lock ATI out](#cluster16) of the [business](#cluster14) of [supplying](#cluster15) graphics chipsets to Intel-based PCs , worth about $ 90 million a year in revenue . AMD [says](#cluster17) there 's plenty of [reason](#cluster18) to be bullish on the [deal](#cluster2) .

RBC Capital Markets [downgraded](#cluster19) ATI Technologies to `` [sector perform](#cluster20) '' from `` [outperform](#cluster21) '' after Advanced Micro Devices [announced](#cluster9) its [intention](#cluster22) to [buy](#cluster2) the Canadian graphics chip-maker for $ 5.4 billion on Monday . Even though the [takeover](#cluster2) [looks](#cluster29) fairly [valued](#cluster23) , RBC analyst Steve Arthur [said](#cluster30) there is [limited](#cluster28) [upside](#cluster31) to the [offer](#cluster24) unless [competing](#cluster26) [bids](#cluster25) are [made](#cluster27) for ATI . For now , Arthur [said](#cluster36) AMD 's [takeover](#cluster2) [deal](#cluster33) , which is [expected](#cluster35) to [close](#cluster32) in the fourth quarter , effectively [offers](#cluster34) his one-year price target of $ 21 now .

The pitched [battle](#cluster39) for [supremacy](#cluster40) in the [chip-making market](#cluster41) [reached](#cluster37) a critical phase yesterday with Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) in Sunnyvale , Calif . [announcing](#cluster9) its [decision](#cluster38) to [acquire](#cluster2) Canadian graphic cards manufacturer ATI Technologies ( ATI ) . The imminent [purchase](#cluster2) of ATI , analysts [say](#cluster44) , is the most vital element in AMD 's concerted [campaign](#cluster42) to [dethrone](#cluster43) the mighty Intel Corp . AMD [agreed](#cluster33) to [buy](#cluster2) Markham , Ont-based ATI for around $ 5.4 billion in cash and stock , the companies [announced](#cluster9) Monday . The [acquisition](#cluster2) , which is [subject](#cluster47) to shareholder and regulatory [approvals](#cluster45) , would [turn](#cluster46) AMD into one of the world 's largest providers of graphics chips . `` You wo n't [see](#cluster50) it tomorrow , but the [merger](#cluster2) will potentially [put AMD on a more equal footing with](#cluster48) Intel , '' [said](#cluster49) Michelle Warren , an analyst with Evans Research in Toronto . Another Canadian analyst [noted](#cluster52) that the [merger](#cluster2) was likely to [bring](#cluster51) significant benefits to both companies . The marketing [message](#cluster53) from ATI executives too is all about the 'mutual benefits ' of the proposed [acquisition](#cluster2) . Hartog [said](#cluster57) the [purchase](#cluster2) of ATI by AMD will [involve](#cluster54) ' some [changes](#cluster55) ' but he [downplayed](#cluster58) any potential [lay-offs](#cluster56) from among the company 's more than 3,000 employees .

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. [shook up](#cluster60) the personal [computer industry](#cluster62) by [buying](#cluster2) ATI Technologies Inc. for US $ 5.4-billion yesterday , [opening up](#cluster59) a new [front](#cluster63) in the [battle](#cluster39) with Intel Corp. to [control](#cluster61) the computer [chip market](#cluster41) . The [deal](#cluster33) , which had been [anticipated](#cluster67) for over a year , [gives](#cluster66) AMD high-end graphics technology and [bolsters](#cluster68) the company 's [strategy](#cluster69) to [overtake](#cluster64) Intel as the dominant supplier of chips that [power](#cluster65) personal computers and other devices .

Advanced Micro Devices ( NYSE : AMD ) [announced](#cluster9) the largest [acquisition](#cluster2) in its [history](#cluster71) Monday , [paying](#cluster70) about $ 5.4 billion to [acquire](#cluster2) graphics chip specialist ATI Technologies . The [acquisition](#cluster2) will [let](#cluster72) AMD [expand](#cluster73) its [position](#cluster75) in the commercial desktop and mobile computing [markets](#cluster74) , two areas where the company has not had much [success](#cluster76) . `` Together we [intend](#cluster77) to [create](#cluster78) a [processing](#cluster80) powerhouse , '' [said](#cluster81) Hector Ruiz , chairman and chief executive of AMD , during a [teleconference](#cluster79) to [announce](#cluster9) the [deal](#cluster2) . The [purchase](#cluster2) is a [combination](#cluster82) of $ 4.2 billion in cash and 57 million shares of AMD stock .

[Addressing](#cluster84) a [deficiency](#cluster85) of its own and further upping the competitive [tension](#cluster39) between it and chief rival Intel ( nasdaq : INTC - news - people ) , Advanced Micro Devices ( nyse : AMD - news - people ) [intends](#cluster83) to [acquire](#cluster2) graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies ( nasdaq : ATYT - news - people ) in a $ 5.4 billion [deal](#cluster2) . We [think](#cluster93) not too much worse off than before the [deal](#cluster2) , and [believe](#cluster89) shares in the company [remain](#cluster86) a compelling [way](#cluster94) to [play](#cluster88) [growth](#cluster87) in [gaming-](#cluster91) and [media-oriented](#cluster92) [computing](#cluster90) . Our [view](#cluster101) of the Advanced Micro Devices / ATI Technologies [deal](#cluster2) is that [it](#cluster2) 's the last major [move](#cluster2) AMD [needed](#cluster95) to [make](#cluster100) to [match](#cluster99) Intel 's [breadth](#cluster103) in the processor [market](#cluster102) ( now that Intel has [shed](#cluster98) its [communications](#cluster97) processor [business](#cluster96) ) .

Yesterday Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD ) , a leading global CPU maker , [announced](#cluster9) its [purchase](#cluster2) of Canada-based graphics chips maker ATI Technologies Inc. in a US $ 5.4 billion [deal](#cluster2) [that](#cluster2) many [said](#cluster105) would [help](#cluster104) AMD [compete](#cluster39) more effectively with Intel Corp. , its largest-in-the-world rival . In a news [conference](#cluster107) [announcing](#cluster9) the [merger](#cluster2) [held](#cluster108) in Taipei yesterday , Henri Richard , executive vice president of AMD , [urged](#cluster109) investors not to [worry](#cluster111) as ATI 's [relations](#cluster106) with TSMC and its rival United Microelectronics Corp. would not [change](#cluster110) . The [merger](#cluster2) , meanwhile , is also [expected](#cluster114) to [create](#cluster113) an [impact](#cluster112) on Taiwan 's chipset manufacturers .

AMD 's ATI [acquisition](#cluster2) will not affect India operations The AMD statement [said](#cluster118) , `` We can not [speculate](#cluster119) on the [implications](#cluster116) of the [merger](#cluster2) for another 90-120 days , till the time [integration](#cluster117) is [complete](#cluster115) .
