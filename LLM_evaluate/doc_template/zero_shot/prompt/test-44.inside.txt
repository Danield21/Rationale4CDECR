[Industry](#cluster11) analysts [contacted](#cluster2) by eWEEK generally [say](#cluster8) they [believe](#cluster5) that Hewlett-Packard 's forthcoming $ 13.9 billion [acquisition](#cluster1) of Electronic Data Systems ? [announced](#cluster9) officially on May 13 is a good [move](#cluster1) for both companies , although there will be the usual integration [snafus](#cluster6) over vendor [neutrality](#cluster10) [issues](#cluster7) , business lines , [culture shock](#cluster3) and [layoffs](#cluster4) . For high-end enterprise IT [services](#cluster12) before this [merger](#cluster1) , the [market](#cluster14) [consisted of](#cluster13) IBM and everybody else . Overall , my [take](#cluster17) is that this [transaction](#cluster1) sounds great [in theory](#cluster16) , but there many potential [pitfalls](#cluster15) . At least initially , Sturm [said](#cluster19) , there will be little noticeable [impact](#cluster18) on customers from the [deal](#cluster1) .

Hewlett-Packard is [negotiating](#cluster26) to [buy](#cluster1) [technology services](#cluster27) provider Electronic Data Systems in a [deal](#cluster20) that could [help](#cluster22) the world 's largest personal computer maker [snap up](#cluster21) more [data management](#cluster25) and [consulting](#cluster23) [contracts](#cluster24) . Palo Alto-based HP and Plano , Texas-based EDS [confirmed](#cluster29) the [talks](#cluster26) yesterday shortly after The Wall Street Journal [reported](#cluster30) a [deal](#cluster20) could be [reached](#cluster28) as early as today . With a [market value](#cluster33) of about $ 115 billion , HP could easily [use](#cluster32) its own stock to [finance](#cluster31) the [purchase](#cluster1) . If the [deal](#cluster20) is [completed](#cluster34) , [it](#cluster20) would be HP 's biggest [acquisition](#cluster1) since it [bought](#cluster35) Compaq Computer Corp. for $ 19 billion in 2002 . [Acquiring](#cluster1) EDS also could [yield](#cluster37) more government [work](#cluster36) for HP , which had about $ 500 million in prime federal [contracts](#cluster38) in fiscal 2007 .

The all-cash [deal](#cluster1) , [announced](#cluster43) Tuesday , [represents](#cluster41) HP 's biggest [gamble](#cluster39) under the [leadership](#cluster44) of Mark Hurd , who was [hired](#cluster40) as chief executive in March 2005 to [turn around](#cluster42) the maker of personal computers and printers . Hewlett-Packard 's [purchase](#cluster1) of Electronic Data Systems could [mean](#cluster45) tougher competition for IBM and its 10,500 Triangle employees . HP [estimates](#cluster50) that the [deal](#cluster1) , when [completed](#cluster46) , will [give](#cluster49) it about 7 percent of the [technology services](#cluster47) [market](#cluster51) , [compared](#cluster48) with IBM 's 10 percent share . `` It appears to be a very [daunting](#cluster52) [deal](#cluster1) , '' [said](#cluster53) American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu .

The [repercussions](#cluster55) from the [merger](#cluster1) of Electronic Data Systems ( EDS Quote - Cramer on EDS - Stock Picks ) with Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ Quote - Cramer on HPQ - Stock Picks ) will [ripple](#cluster54) broadly throughout the [tech industry](#cluster56) . H-P [announced](#cluster9) Tuesday that it will [buy](#cluster1) the outsourcing [services](#cluster27) company for $ 13.9 billion . The [deal](#cluster20) will be bad `` for anyone that does n't [have](#cluster58) H-P or IBM ( IBM Quote - Cramer on IBM - Stock Picks ) on their business card , '' [said](#cluster57) IDC analyst Bob Welch .

[Industry](#cluster60) sources have [confirmed](#cluster59) to eWEEK that Hewlett-Packard will [acquire](#cluster1) Electronic Data Systems for about $ 13 billion . The [announcement](#cluster9) may [come](#cluster61) as early as May 14 , the source [told](#cluster62) eWEEK . `` There can be no [assurances](#cluster67) that an [agreement](#cluster20) will be [reached](#cluster64) or that a [transaction](#cluster20) will be [consummated](#cluster63) , '' HP [said](#cluster65) in a [statement](#cluster66) . In [response](#cluster69) to [market](#cluster71) [rumors](#cluster68) , Electronic Data Systems Corporation [announces](#cluster70) that it is in advanced [discussions](#cluster26) regarding a possible business combination [transaction](#cluster20) with Hewlett-Packard Company . The [impending](#cluster72) [deal](#cluster20) would [make](#cluster73) the newly merged company worth about $ 22 billion and [put it on a level](#cluster74) with IBM , the largest IT services company in the world .

It 's too early to [tell](#cluster76) what [impact](#cluster78) - if any - Hewlett-Packard Co. 's decision to [acquire](#cluster1) Electronic Data Systems Corp. will [have](#cluster75) on EDS ' [operations](#cluster77) in South Charleston , an EDS spokesman [said](#cluster79) . Earlier this month Hewlett-Packard [unveiled](#cluster9) a [bid](#cluster80) of nearly $ 14 billion bid to [purchase](#cluster1) EDS . Bill Ritz , EDS spokesman , [pointed out](#cluster81) that Hewlett-Packard 's [acquisition](#cluster1) of EDS still [needs](#cluster82) the [approval](#cluster83) of regulators and EDS ' stockholders . `` The [deal](#cluster20) is [supposed](#cluster85) to [close](#cluster84) sometime in the second half of 2008 , '' Ritz [said](#cluster86) .

Hewlett-Packard 's CEO [says](#cluster90) he [believes](#cluster87) the EDS [acquisition](#cluster1) will [make](#cluster88) the company 's [service offerings](#cluster89) stronger . Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd [believes](#cluster87) that the $ 13 billion [acquisition](#cluster1) of Electronic Data Systems will [help](#cluster91) [build out](#cluster92) HP 's enterprise [services offerings](#cluster94) and `` [accelerate](#cluster93) '' the company 's [reach](#cluster95) into new accounts , he [said](#cluster90) . In a May 20 [conference call](#cluster96) with reporters to [announce](#cluster99) HP 's 2008 second-quarter financial earnings , Hurd [offered](#cluster97) his [thoughts](#cluster98) on the upcoming [acquisition](#cluster1) of EDS . While Hurd could not [say](#cluster106) when the [deal](#cluster20) would [close](#cluster100) , he [noted](#cluster105) that HP is already [looking at](#cluster101) [ways](#cluster104) to [integrate](#cluster102) its software and services portfolio with EDS ' [business](#cluster103) .
