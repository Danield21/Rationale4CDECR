Israel 's [assault](#cluster4) on Gaza has [exacted](#cluster6) the bloodiest [toll](#cluster2) of civilian lives yet , when the [bombing](#cluster5) of UN schools being [used](#cluster1) as refugee centres and of housing [killed](#cluster3) more than 50 people , including an entire family of seven young children . Doctors in Gaza [said](#cluster12) more than 40 people [died](#cluster3) , including children , in what appears to be the biggest single [loss of life](#cluster11) of the [campaign](#cluster9) when Israeli bombs [hit](#cluster5) al-Fakhora school , in Jabaliya refugee camp , while it was [packed](#cluster7) with hundreds of people who had [fled](#cluster10) the [fighting](#cluster8) .

No militants were [inside](#cluster14) a United Nations-run school [attacked](#cluster5) by Israeli forces in Gaza , [leaving 40 people dead](#cluster3) , the UN [says](#cluster13) .

The United Nations on Wednesday [denied](#cluster16) Israel Defense Forces [claims](#cluster15) that there were Palestinian militants in the Gaza school [bombed](#cluster5) by Israel on Tuesday .

SEVENTEEN hours after the [attack](#cluster5) on one of his schools [killed](#cluster3) 40 Palestinians [seeking](#cluster17) [shelter](#cluster22) from Israel 's [war](#cluster18) on Hamas , the United Nations ' director of operations in Gaza , John Ging , was certain of at least one thing `` We have [established](#cluster19) beyond any [doubt](#cluster20) that the school was not being [used](#cluster14) by any militants , '' Mr Ging [told](#cluster21) The Age last night . [Speaking](#cluster28) by phone from the UN 's Relief and Works Agency in Gaza , Mr Ging [struggled](#cluster26) to [contain](#cluster25) his [anger](#cluster29) at the [attack](#cluster5) that has also [left](#cluster24) more 50 people with serious [injuries](#cluster27) , 10 of whom [remain](#cluster23) critical . When the Israeli [attack](#cluster5) [came](#cluster30) on the Prep C girls school in the Jabaliya camp at 3.45pm on Tuesday , Mr Ging [said](#cluster31) about 350 Palestinians were inside , [using](#cluster17) the school as a shelter . The [attack](#cluster5) on the school has [caused](#cluster32) widespread [shock](#cluster35) across Israel , [intensifying](#cluster33) [pressure](#cluster37) on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to [reach](#cluster34) a [ceasefire](#cluster36) .

Some 30 people were [killed](#cluster3) and 55 others [injured](#cluster38) , five of them critically , when three artillery shells [landed](#cluster5) at the perimeter of a school , which usually serves as a girls ' preparatory school , in the Jabaliya refugee camp , [according to](#cluster39) John Ging , UNRWA 's Director of Operations .

[Pressure](#cluster45) to [obtain](#cluster40) a [ceasefire](#cluster42) in Gaza has been [mounting](#cluster43) , with the EU [warning](#cluster44) Israel it was `` [destroying](#cluster41) '' its image , while Israeli forces on Tuesday ( 6 January ) [killed](#cluster3) at least 40 people during an [attack](#cluster5) on a United Nations-run school in Gaza . The Israeli [attack](#cluster5) on the Fakhora school in the northern town of Jabaliya , which also [wounded](#cluster46) around 100 people , was the deadliest single [strike](#cluster5) of the offensive so far and the third UN school to come under fire within 24 hours . The [bombing](#cluster5) has [drawn](#cluster49) international [condemnation](#cluster47) , with the EU [calling](#cluster48) [it](#cluster5) `` completely unacceptable . '' `` We [think](#cluster52) the [attack](#cluster5) is completely unacceptable and strongly [condemn](#cluster53) the fact that civilians were [hit](#cluster50) while [sheltering](#cluster51) themselves from the [violence](#cluster54) , '' [said](#cluster55) Cristina Gallach , spokesperson of EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana .

An Israeli [mortar strike](#cluster5) that [killed](#cluster3) about 40 Palestinians [sheltering](#cluster57) in a UN school Tuesday [brought](#cluster58) new urgency to diplomatic efforts to [end](#cluster56) Israel 's military onslaught in the Gaza Strip , as the UN Security Council [met](#cluster60) to [discuss](#cluster59) the [crisis](#cluster61) . The Israeli army [said](#cluster15) the UN school in the Jabaliya refugee camp was [hit](#cluster5) when troops [responded](#cluster62) to a [mortar attack](#cluster63) from the grounds and that the dead [included](#cluster64) a number of Hamas militants . The [mortar strike](#cluster5) in Jabaliya was the second [attack](#cluster5) on a school [run](#cluster65) by the UN Relief and Works Agency , or UNRWA .

The civilian [death toll](#cluster69) in Gaza [increased](#cluster68) dramatically today , with [reports](#cluster70) of more than 40 Palestinians [killed](#cluster3) after missiles [exploded](#cluster5) outside a UN school where hundreds of people were [sheltering](#cluster66) from the continuing Israeli [offensive](#cluster67) . Two Israeli tank shells [struck](#cluster5) the school in Jabaliya refugee camp , [spraying](#cluster71) shrapnel on people inside and outside the building , [according to](#cluster72) news agency [reports](#cluster73) . Majed Hamdan , an AP photographer , who [rushed](#cluster74) to the scene shortly after the [attacks](#cluster5) , [said](#cluster75) many children were among the dead .

THE UN has [disputed](#cluster16) [claims](#cluster15) that Hamas militants [fired](#cluster76) mortars from the Gaza school that has [suffered](#cluster77) the deadliest [attack](#cluster5) of the [war](#cluster18) with Israel . Three shells [hit](#cluster5) Fakhura , a girls elementary school in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza , at about 3pm on Tuesday ( 12am yesterday ) , [according to](#cluster78) UN Relief and Works Agency spokesman Christopher Gunness . Israel [moved](#cluster80) quickly to [explain](#cluster79) the [attack](#cluster5) on the Jabalya school , [saying](#cluster15) its forces had been [fired on](#cluster81) first . He and other men had been [sitting](#cluster82) in the schoolyard when shells [hit](#cluster5) the compound .
