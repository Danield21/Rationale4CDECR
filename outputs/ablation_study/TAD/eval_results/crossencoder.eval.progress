Some weights of the model checkpoint at ./models/roberta-large were not used when initializing RobertaModel: ['lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.weight', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
